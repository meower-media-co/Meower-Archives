        <b>Update 6-27-21</b>
        <br>
        What's up? Just a minor update. Added shadow to buttons. Look!
        <br><br>
        <button>Here!</button>
        <br><br>
        Still needs some fixing, but it's not like I'm the greatest CSS maker. ðŸ˜…

        <br>
        Hey guys! About a year ago, me and some friends designed default profile pictures for Openly, another Meower Media project we used to work on. I added them here so expect to see accounts coming!
        <br>
        Edit: We didn't start coding accounts yet so don't get your hopes up.

        I found out that there's a new meower+ website so now I'm helping! I forgot a lot of my HTML skills so let's just see how this goes...

        <br>
        Hey all! I'm working on the website too even though I am not the owner anymore! I'm currently adding codeblocks so expect some changes. Also, I think I'll change
        the font to Helvetica Neue for all systems (With TTF of course) because I'm using a Mac currently and it looks great. Expect that change!
        <br>
        Edit: Instead changed to Arial. Working on codeblocks!

        Hello, it's me, zedthehedgehog who is part of the Meower and Meower+ team. I am back with another update to the website. I removed the "Thread" link on top of every page. I was thinking of adding it back as a button instead.
        I'm currently making a new home page. The old one was pretty bland.

        I'm back with another Update. I think development for Meower+ will start after Meower (the one on scratch) releases. I haven't really done anything right now (other than make this site and some posts), but I hope development will start soon because the thread is pretty inactive at times. ANYWAYS, I added a thingy on the right. I think its cool.

        <b>Announcement 6-22-21</b>
        <br>
          Welcome to the new Meower+ website. Things looked a little bit messy on the last one, so I thought i'd just make a new website for Meower+. I'll make it simple for now, so users can easily edit the website into a actual social media. But for now, it's like this. The old Meower+ site is intact. I hope to see you soon!!
