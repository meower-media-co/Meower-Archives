        I added a small framework thingy that adds a new post. I hope this adds a bit more simplicity when adding servers in the future.

        Wow, I'm surprised <br>
        I didn't know Meower was still alive and well, and it seems Meower on Scratch is doing pretty well considering its on its Beta stages. I'm assuming cloud is added there. Anyways, I assume Meower Scratch is nearing its full launch, even though it got delayed like 5 times? Anyway, the future is looking quite bright. I expect Meower+ development to start quite soon......
        <br>
        But until we meet again.. Meow on!

          Added cool buttons thanks to CST person. You can close blog posts! Like you'll ever need that right
          <br>
          Linebreaks won't clear so we have to fix that, and upper-tab id is buggy af. 
          <br>
          and finally this website doesn't look that bad in ie8 but it's not great lol. 
          <br>
          also porting to nodejs maybe...? i feel like we can just use fetch() but yeah.

          The CSS has been minified to lessen loading time. Anyways, this website is <b>FULL STEAM AHEAD IN DEVELOPMENT!</b> And uh, pretty sure IE8 can't support this website. Or any IE version. IE sucks. Bury and forget about it.

         I'm back, I decided to go check the site, and i see some cool changes like how the navbar takes up 100% of the page now. I also see there is a new domain applied onto the site. That's cool!

        What's up? Just a minor update. Added shadow to buttons. Look!
        <br><br>
        <button>Here!</button>
        <br><br>
        Still needs some fixing, but it's not like I'm the greatest CSS maker. ðŸ˜…

        Hey Guys, I'm BakeAPotato. I'm one of the people working on meower as one of the designers. I've made 4 default profile pictures so far. A blue one, a red one, a yellow one, annd a green one. I'm about to make an orange one. 
        <br>
        Edit: I'm back.

        Hey guys! About a year ago, me and some friends designed default profile pictures for Openly, another Meower Media project we used to work on. I added them here so expect to see accounts coming!
        <br>
        Edit: We didn't start coding accounts yet so don't get your hopes up.

        I found out that there's a new meower+ website so now I'm helping! I forgot a lot of my HTML skills so let's just see how this goes...

        Hey all! I'm working on the website too even though I am not the owner anymore! I'm currently adding codeblocks so expect some changes. Also, I think I'll change
        the font to Helvetica Neue for all systems (With TTF of course) because I'm using a Mac currently and it looks great. Expect that change!
        <br>
        Edit: Instead changed to Arial. Working on codeblocks!

        Hello, it's me, zedthehedgehog who is part of the Meower and Meower+ team. I am back with another update to the website. I removed the "Thread" link on top of every page. I was thinking of adding it back as a button instead.
        I'm currently making a new home page. The old one was pretty bland.

        I'm back with another Update. I think development for Meower+ will start after Meower (the one on scratch) releases. I haven't really done anything right now (other than make this site and some posts), but I hope development will start soon because the thread is pretty inactive at times. ANYWAYS, I added a thingy on the right. I think its cool.

          Welcome to the new Meower+ website. Things looked a little bit messy on the last one, so I thought i'd just make a new website for Meower+. I'll make it simple for now, so users can easily edit the website into a actual social media. But for now, it's like this. The old Meower+ site is intact. I hope to see you soon!!
