# Yoom!
Welcome to Yoom! Yoom is an open-source, free to use, privacy-focused social media platform, written with Scratch 3, JavaScript, and Python. Created by MikeDEV. Owned by Meower Media Co.

### What does Yoom mean?
Yoom is an abbreviation of "Your Own Online Messenger", to emphasize users to take control of their information, as well as contribute to a more privacy-focused social media environment.

### Where did it begin?
Yoom started development in the early Scratch 3.0 era. With code entirely written specifically for Scratch, it was designed to be a modern, user-friendly and simple platform for people to collaborate and interact. [However, along came the ban on cloud chats.](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/357609/) With that, Yoom was effectively dead. However, not for long. Development of CloudLink began, and Yoom slowly revived. Then along came Meower. With the acquisition of Meower Media Co., Yoom became Meower's sister project and officially supported fork.

### Where will Yoom go?
We plan on keeping true to it's origins: A completely open-source social media platform written using Scratch. Nothing more, nothing less.

### What technologies will we use?
* Scratch 3.0 - A simple, easy-to-use, block-based programming language aimed at young children.
* CloudLink - A powerful websocket extension written for Scratch 3.0.
* TurboWarp - For fast development times and powerful compiling.
