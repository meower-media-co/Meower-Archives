      <h3>What's Special?</h3>
      Special Coding Language For snippets of code from special coding languages
      (such as code that isn't text-based such as scratch) we have special
      editors for Scratch, Snap, or other coding languages that are not
      text-based, or use special characters.<br />
      <b>Non-Profit</b><br />
      It's FREE! Everyone can have fun, and share with everyone!<br />
      <b>No ads!</b><br />
      We think there shouldn't be any distractions in your experience in openly.
      I mean, we don't want any party-poopers right?
