# The Openly & Gamr projects

The Openly & Gamr projects were started as a side-project to Meower which started on the original Scratch forum thread. Openly has never had a properly-functional version until @williamhorning's Deno version of Openly, which is archived at his [archives repo](https://github.com/williamhorning/archives), which is licensed under the MIT license. The versions of Openly and Gamr here are released under the MIT license and owned by their contributors.

## Openly

Openly is a code-snippet sharing platform that was supposed to be similar to [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) but with built-in runners for various languages. The project has died numerous times, being revived by @Touchcreator, @williamhorning, and @zedthehedgehog at various points. The closest it has ever gotten to being functional was @williamhorning's Deno version, which was abandoned due to the lack of interest in the project.

## Gamr

Gamr is similar to Openly, focusing on game development. It died in 2021, with no one reviving the project except for a rewrite of the website, which was also abandoned.
