      <h1>Terms of Service (updated November 12, 2020)</h1>
      <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Openly! We hope you enjoy our service, with love from the
        Openly Team. However, to enjoy Openly, there are some rules you must
        follow, and breaking these rules may result in moderation action being
        taken against your account (and the possible disruption of others'
        Openly experience).
      </p>

      <h2>Section 2: Warning Points</h2>
      <p>
        Once you violate the Terms of Service (hereinafter "ToS"), Warning
        Points will be added to your account. <br /><br />
        Warning Points are given on a scale of 1-10 depending on the severity of
        the rule.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Extremely Minor Violation</li>
        <li>Very Minor Violation</li>
        <li>Minor Violation</li>
        <li>Slightly Moderate Violation</li>
        <li>Moderate Violation</li>
        <li>Intermediate Violation</li>
        <li>High Violation</li>
        <!-- better name plz -->
        <li>Higher Violation</li>
        <!-- better name plz -->
        <li>Final Warning</li>
        <li>Unacceptable Violation</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Breaking a rule that earns more than 3 Warning Points will result in a
        personal warning from a moderator.<br /><br />Getting 10 Warning Points
        in total on your account will result in you getting banned for a certain
        period of time, and getting more than 10 Warning Points will result in a
        permanent ban (hereinafter "termination") on your account and under your
        IP address.<br /><br />Being banned does not reset your Warning Points,
        so another broken rule would result in a termination.
      </p>

      <h2>Section 3: Rules</h2>
      <h3>Age Restriction</h3>
      <!-- idk if we need this, but just in case -->
