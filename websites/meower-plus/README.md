# Meower Plus

This folder contains the two versions of Meower Plus, an attempt to build an HTML version of Meower that was seperate from the Scratch version. This died due to a lack of development, with the idea being realised by the Meower-HTML5 project, deprecated in favour of Meower-Svelte and Meower-SvelteKit.
