According to all known community guidelines on Scratch, there is no way for a chat project to get hyper-popular without the Scratch username @griffpatch. It’ll either die in the discussions, tab or mass an amount of less than 15 minutes of fame. The Meower project and Meower Media Co. however, tries anyway because Meower Media Co doesn’t care for what other people think.

And so it has happened. Meower, which can only be used to discuss cats, is rapidly gaining popularity thanks to the chat bots. Meower Media Co. has seen a rise in income since launching Meower, mainly because Meower Media Co. charges users to join its community. The bots are also being bought and sold at a rate of about seven thousand dollars a day.

The popularity of Meower, and Meower Media Co. in general, are also attracting the attention of the SEC. SEC documents filed Tuesday afternoon, June 18, 2018, reveal that Meower Media Co. received approximately $50 million in funding from investors, including a $25 million offering made June 15. Investors were encouraged to join the Meower community by offering up to $200,000 in stock tokens to join the chat platform in the form of a “Meow Token”. The SEC is currently examining whether Meower Media Co. and investors violated the terms of Meower’s initial funding or if they were offering securities to the public without adequate disclosures and with fraudulent statements.

Meower Media Co. issued a statement at the end of June, which read, “It is our intention to bring Meower to life by providing all of its users with a community based upon the sharing of information and entertainment, in addition to providing them with the opportunity to interact with others on a more personal level. Our investors, advisors, and community are extremely important to our vision, and that vision is Meower Media Co. We sincerely apologize for any misinformation or miscommunication that we have caused during this time.”
The SEC has ordered the chat platform to cease operation, which has caused the community to go into turmoil. Many Meower users are furious and are calling for a boycott of the company and its platform, claiming that they have been duped into purchasing Meower Tokens and that they are victims of a Ponzi scheme.

This is a story on what happened when Meower Media Co. attempted to build Meower by utilizing a Scratch Chat Application in the process. It would be in the form of an app that would let Meowerians communicate with one another outside of Scratch’s chat system.

The Meowerian chat app was tested using the Scratch 3.2.8 framework, which had no problem using it. The only thing was that the Scratch chat did not have any way to connect to the outside world. Without an outside world to connect to, the chat could not be used.

Meower was the only one who could actually connect to the chat app. It was Meower that knew where to find everything and how to build a message app. Without Meower knowing where to find it, Meowerians wouldn’t be able to join a chat or even a forum. Meower created a whole new chat forum for this purpose.

Not only could Meower do this, but Meower Media Co. decided to give away the Scratch chat as a free app to everyone.

The Meower project and Meower Media Co. however, tries anyway because Meower Media Co doesn’t care for what other people think. It is the best social media.

The Meower project is not the most advanced of social media out there because of it’s popularity. All of the features of a social media platform are present, except it has little to no user base and it is very difficult to share a project outside of Scratch (even impossible).

What is Meower?

The Meower project is a very simplistic, low res implementation of a social media platform. All of the features are included and the platform is very useful. The users of the project are often confused because they aren’t looking at the whole picture.

Meower was not designed to compete with existing social media platforms. No one is making a profit from it. In fact, nothing is really being made at all. The only purpose is to bring the community together and see what it can do.

There is no real way to make a profit from a social media platform like Meower, so it’s not worth making one. In the end, it will just get out of hand.
This project was not created to turn into a social media powerhouse. It’s not created to compete with anything. If you need something to talk about in the community, Meower is the perfect platform for you.
