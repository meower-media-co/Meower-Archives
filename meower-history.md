# Meower's History
A full and detailed list of the great history of Meower (and Meower Media Co.)!
## One *first* thing...
This had been updated for mmc-archives. The original repository is now a public archive, and had been moved to Wiki Meower. The following document *also* has some changes current and old (whatever that means).
## Disclaimer
Meower Media Co is merely an alias towards the collaborators of  The Meower Project, and is in no way, shape, or form, a legal entity. This project has no intentions to harass or promote hatred torwards Scratch itself, but it does bring into precedent some of it's current issues with the ST.
## Foreword
According to all known community guidelines on Scratch, (not bees, but rather Scratch Cats that get generated every time you make a new project) there is no way for a chat project to get hyper-popular without the Scratch username [@griffpatch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/griffpatch/). It'll either die in the discussions, tab or mass an amount of less than 15 minutes of fame. The Meower project and Meower Media Co., however, tries anyway because Meower Media Co doesn't care for what other people think, because Meower Media Co. gives and Meower Media Co. takes, your obsolete chat platform.
